This web component allows to search for available parking spots near a specified location or within a designated area. Developers can input a location as parameter and the component will display nearby parking options in widgets. Each widget shows the current number of free spots available at that parking location.

## Usage

Include the webcompscript file `dist/near-parking-available.min.js` in your HTML and define the web component like this:

```html
<near-parking-available
  coordinates="11.356305,46.496449"
></near-parking-available>
```

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running
on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build the project, the following prerequisites must be met:

- Node 12 / NPM 6

### Source code

Get a copy of the repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.inf.unibz.it/Manuel.Villotti/near-parking-available.git
```

Change directory:

```bash
cd near-parking-available/
```

### Dependencies

Download all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Build

Build and start the project:

```bash
npm run start
```

The application will be served and can be accessed at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Deployment

To create the distributable files, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Run with docker

If you want to test the webcomponent on a local instance of the [webcomponent store](https://webcomponents.opendatahub.com/) to make sure that it will run correctly also on the real store.
You can also access the webcomponent running in a simple separated docker container outside of the store.

If you have already developed your webcomponent and now want to test it on a local instance of the store, just copy `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, `wcs-manifest.json` and `infrastructure/docker` into your root folder. Adjust your `package.json` and `wcs-manifest.json` files as described on the top of this readme. Then follow the instructions below.

For accessing the webcomponent in a separated docker in the browser you will need a server (e.g. webpack dev-server) that is hosting a page which includes the webcomponent tag, as well as the script defining it. This page needs to be hosted on port 8080 as specified in your docker-compose file.

### Installation

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (with Docker Compose) locally on your machine.

### Start the docker containers

- Create a .env file: <br>
  `cp .env.example .env`
- [Optional] Adjust port numbers in .env if they have conflicts with services already running on your machine
- Start the store with: <br>
  `docker-compose up -d`
- Wait until the containers are running. You can check the current state with: <br>
  `docker-compose logs --tail 500 -f`
- Access the store in your browser on: <br>
  `localhost:8999`
- Access webcomponent running in separated docker in your browser on: <br>
  `localhost:8998`

### Publish a new version of your webcomponent

- Increase version number WC_VERSION in your .env file
- Then run: `docker-compose up wcstore-cli`

### Stop the docker containers

- `docker-compose stop`

### Delete your webcomponents from the store

- `[sudo] rm -f workspace`
- `docker-compose rm -f -v postgres`

### Documentation

More documentation can be found at [https://docs.opendatahub.com](https://docs.opendatahub.com).

### Boilerplate

The project uses this boilerplate: [https://github.com/noi-techpark/webcomp-boilerplate](https://github.com/noi-techpark/webcomp-boilerplate).

### License

The code in this project is licensed under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 license. See the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for more information.

### REUSE

This project is [REUSE](https://reuse.software) compliant, more information about the usage of REUSE in NOI Techpark repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/noi-techpark/odh-docs/wiki/Guidelines-for-developers-and-licenses#guidelines-for-contributors-and-new-developers).

Since the CI for this project checks for REUSE compliance you might find it useful to use a pre-commit hook checking for REUSE compliance locally. The [pre-commit-config](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file in the repository root is already configured to check for REUSE compliance with help of the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) tool.

Install the tool by running:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

Then install the pre-commit hook via the config file by running:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
